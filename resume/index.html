  <p>I am a sports journalist with a passion for covering professional or collegiate basketball. I have prior experience on a beat after having covered volleyball and women’s lacrosse for the University of Maryland.</p>
<h2>Experience:</h2>
<h3>Editor-in-chief</h3>
<h4>UNCUT College Park</h4>
<h5>January 2021 - present</h5>
  <p>I was selected by peers to run the writing portion of this college version of the Players Tribune and will work closely with student-athletes at the University of Maryland to put together monthly feature stories. Topics I will supervise will be about off the court issues such as race and mental health.</p>
<h3>Staff writer</h3>
<h4>Testudo Times</h4>
<h5>November 2019 - present</h5>
  <p>I am currently the beat writer for the University of Maryland volleyball team and I was previously the women’s lacrosse beat writer in the Spring of 2020 prior to the coronavirus pandemic cancelling play. Prior to that, I was on the publication’s general assignment team, putting together recaps of Maryland athletics-related news.</p>
<h3>Assistant to chief branding officer (Internship)</h3>
<h4>Sun Belt Conference</h4>
<h5>September 2020 - December 2020</h5>
  <p>I was a student assistant for a remote internship with the Sun Belt Conference based in New Orleans. I helped the chief branding officer with multiple responsibilities throughout the day such as Twitter posts for upcoming football games, drafting press releases and other general organization tasks.</p>

<h2>Skills:</h2>

    <li>Social media management. I have sufficient experience on social media. On Twitter, I assisted the Sun Belt Conference in their posts and for my beat with Testudo Times I would live tweet during games.</li>
